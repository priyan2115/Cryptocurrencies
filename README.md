# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised MachineLearning

**The purpose of the repository and short description of what was accomplished. Although there is no graded written analysis for this challenge, it is encouraged and good practice to add a brief description of your project**.

# Purpose of the Repository:
   **In this Repository or this module is to learn the another Machine Learning Technique. Before this we learn about the Supervised Machine Learning and in this module we learn about the Unsupervised machine Learning.
   Here, we axccomplished the challenge assignment about cryptocurrency where we have some data about the cryptocurrencies as csv file called crypto_data.csv we load this csv as Dataframe and then ,
  In the first part we preprocessing the data for PCA(principle componenet analysis),Then in the second part with the use of PCA we deduct the data dimentions, and create new DataFrame with 3 principal componenets, in the third part we used the KMeans and predict clusters and create Elbow curve and create new DataFrame called Clusters_df. The last part is the visualization of this Result as the form of 3D scatter plot from  PCA data and cluster predictions, Table of tradable cryptocurrencies and 2D scatter plot from that table.
